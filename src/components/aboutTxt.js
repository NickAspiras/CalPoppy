const aboutSPR = [`Swanton Pacific Ranch (SPR) is a 3200-acre satellite property of California Polytechnic State University 
located in Santa Cruz County off Highway 1, ~60 miles south of San Francisco. The land is composed of a majestic redwood forest, 
lush riverine ecosystems, and expansive coastal grassland overlooking the bay and the Pacific Ocean. It was donated to Cal Poly 
by alumni Al Smith in 1993. Smith’s goal was for the land to be “maintained as a working ranch and used exclusively for 
agriculture, recreational, educational purposes.” Since its donation, the Ranch has been managed by Cal Poly’s College of 
Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences. Faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates actively pursue research 
opportunities, utilizing the forest, range, and watershed resources within the ranch.`,
`Due to the lack of signage off of Highway 1 and the inability of ranch staff to constantly be availiable to field questions, 
sharing the rich history and research opportunities of Swanton Pacific Ranch has always been a problem. Due to a fire destroying 
much of the ranch (including many landmarks and a lot of physical data) in late summer 2020, the necessity to preserve and spread 
knowledge of the ranch has become a priority. So, a plan was devised to provide access to this information through an interactive, 
remotely updated, creative outreach tool for researchers and the public, requiring no mediation...and Poppy the Chatbot was born!
